We’ve provided a basic front-end page: Go to https://wewantwaste.co.uk/ then enter the postcode LE10 1SH and select an address, then select garden waste. On the next page you will see a ‘choose your skip size’ page 
This is the target page which we want you to redesign.
Your goal is to redesign the whole page to look completely different from the original page. You should keep its functionality intact.
Focus on clean, maintainable react code, responsiveness, and UI/UX improvements.
You need to incorporate the page to display correctly on mobile web browser and desktop
Use the data from this link to populate the skip options https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft
